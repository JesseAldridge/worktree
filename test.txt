    sketch
      do we want something like this?
        so how would the code search work?
          "30x30 matrix"
          "For each cell, there is a 10% chance it has a mine on it"
            for is a key word
          code
            for r...  for c...  matrix.push
            for cell in grid ...
          so one module calls it matrix and one calls it grid
            uniform terminology?
              synonym handler?
                matrix array2d array_2 arr board tiles g b
                try replacing one var name with a corresponding one then run and check outputs
        will probably want to customize the functions in some way
          searching would be a big enough of a step up to be worth it by itself?
            still going to have to understand the code?
              not having to write it would be a significant step forward
              as long as the output is right and it's fast enough it's fine?
                could be side-effects
                  purely functional language?
        or do we want the code search approach?
        the idea is to minimize the amount of work involved in programming
          code search would probably have the most impact
          automatically stitching modules together might be cool though
            would work for functional languages, but what about those that rely on state?
              could limit search to functional languages

"programming in a higher-level language than the one available" 1
  what would be higher level than functions?
    natural language
    a program
      a collection of functions
        isn't that the same thing as a function?
        maybe I just want a global collection of functions
          with google style search so people can find them
            so maybe what I'm really building is a search language for functions
              search for "30x30 matrix"
                got some code for it
    example
      code
        for var r = 0; r < 30; r++
          for var c = 0; c < 30; c++
            row.push({})
      higher-level
        Grid
          just a function
            grid = function grid() { for r...  for c... }
neural network where the input is keystrokes
  or legal tokens
    combine them in random order
      how do neural networks work?
        what is a recurrent neural network?
        what is deep learning?
          it's just scaled up neural networks?
  pull a bunch of code from github
    try to make something that looks like that
      the code we want here would be much smaller than a random file on github
        notion of large vs small
          hook into exisiting AI code
how would this work for something like modifying gigwalk?
  port certs to association table
    maybe it would just of stuck with the org_cust_meta table
    write migration
    the old data structure needs to be modified in order to add new functionality
      maybe data would not have to be arranged logically
        just take these arbitrary bytes and assign them
          let machine learning do the rest
          following the deep learning approach
          run the thing in a vm?
            an isolated env so it won't wipe prod db?
reminds me of that coding with buttons thing I was working on at one point
translate natural language into code
  fuzzy commands
    grid of buttons
      map "read from a file" -> "read file"
example
  minesweeper
    grid of buttons
  build this with itself
    input is commands
    ???
      substeps
        interpret command
          input: "turn words into code"
        generate code
      stub
        if command == 'turn words into code"
          -
    output is code
  make web app
    <generate flask web app>
start with curl generator
learn to use libraries
  maybe an AI could build its own?
  ask for help
code generation
  quickly build and evaluate combinations of tokens
    all possible python programs
      breadth first
      score them by proximity to real code
read-modify-write loop for code 3
  modify would be the hard part 3
    adding another component which understands the code 3
      generate input examples and see what happens 3
        make a request to every endpoint in a web app 3
          would take a while
          and see what happens
          try this with gigwalk codebase
            there's probably software that does this
            could be dangerous
              what if one endpoint wipes the db?
                can I insert a breakpoint or something to guarentee that nothing will happen?
          computer assisted programming
      easier to just generate from scratch every time?
        not easier for a human that way
          but maybe easier for a computer
maybe it would be better to start as a consultancy 10v / 7h
  stackoverflow for actual working code 7
    building a software product is pretty expensive
      $100K for a fairly simple thing
      maybe there's a market for trivial things
        I bet I could build minesweeper in a day
          10 hours * $100 = $1000 * 3 = $3000
            $300 would be a big gain
    archive of software
    everything open source so others can review it?
      would take a ton of time for that
      why pay for it when anyone else can immediately start using it?
    pretty similar to odesk type sites
      what are people asking for?
      make a version where i own the code produced by all the programmers
        wouldn't the clients want to own the code?
          maybe the client owns it and licenses it to the business
            and the creator as well
          how would the business model work there?
      https://blog.codinghorror.com/can-you-really-rent-a-coder/
        "as a coding assistant they work great"
      rent-a-coder
      upwork (formerly odesk)
      Elance
      guru.com
      could I post jobs on these sites and stitch together modules to build gigwalk?
        find an sqlalchemy expert
        rate the coders
        try getting other people to build cardbrew
  and then add automation over time
  if you took all the software created by all consultants there would be a lot of overlap
    people write code when they could be reusing code from github
      discoverability
  would be tough to add automation if i'm spending all my time working normaly
